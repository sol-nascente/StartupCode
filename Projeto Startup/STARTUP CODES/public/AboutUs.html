        The Challenge: Build a Treasure Hunt Web App The challenge is to build
        an appropriate Web App to use for playing a treasure hunt. This is an
        online quiz where the answers depend on you finding information at
        specific locations. Our Web App uses a provided API in an appropriate
        way to access the clues (questions) and compete by submitting answers.
        We promoted our app with a dedicated Web page, the first page you
        encounter when using our app, and other marketing tools such as social
        media. We used/tested our app in order to make it user-friendly.
